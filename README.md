Welcome to The Wild Oasis Hotel Management Application documentation. The Wild Oasis is a user friendly hotel management application. This application is designed to manage hotel operations, including sales statistics, cabin management, user management, booking management, and various customization options. It integrates authentication, database storage, and dark mode features. And so much more!

The purpose of this project is to implement my advanced <b>Javascript</b>,<strong>Typescript</strong> and <strong>Database Query</strong> skills in a web application and bring it to reality. Moreover, further enhance my knowledge of <strong>ReactJs</strong>.

I believe the best approach to learning something new is <strong>"Learning by Doing"</strong>.
